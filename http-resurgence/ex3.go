// Exercise 3: Header Detective
// Goal
// Create a /headers endpoint that inspects two specific request headers: X-Custom-Token and Content-Type. The handler reads both, reports what it found, and enforces a rule about one of them.

// Key Tasks
// ●     Read X-Custom-Token using r.Header.Get("X-Custom-Token").
// ●     If X-Custom-Token is missing or empty — respond with 400 Bad Request and the message: "X-Custom-Token header is missing".
// ●     If X-Custom-Token is present — respond with a message that includes its value. Example: "Token received: abc123".
// ●     Also read Content-Type and append it to the response. If it is missing, append "Content-Type not provided".
// ●     The full response for a valid request must look like this:
// ○     Token received: abc123
// ○     Content-Type: application/json

// Why this matters —
// ascii-art-web reads r.Header indirectly through template and form handling.
// Understanding how headers work — and what happens when they are absent —
// prepares you for writing handlers that behave correctly under any input.

// Stretch — do this after the core task works
// ●     What does r.Header.Get() return for a header key that was never sent? Write a one-sentence answer in a comment at the top of your file.
// ●     Is r.Header.Get("x-custom-token") the same as r.Header.Get("X-Custom-Token")? Find out.
