// Exercise 1: The Method Inspector
// Goal
// Build a /method-inspector endpoint that reads the HTTP method of every incoming request and echoes it back in a descriptive sentence. No method should be rejected — this handler accepts everything and reports what it sees.

// Key Tasks
// ●     Register a /method-inspector handler using http.HandleFunc.
// ●     Read the request method using r.Method.
// ●     Respond with a plain text message that includes the method name.
// ○     GET request → "You made a GET request."
// ○     POST request → "You made a POST request."
// ○     Any other method → "You made a [METHOD] request."
// ●     Do not hardcode each method with its own if/else branch — use the value of r.Method directly in your response string.

// Why this matters —
// In ascii-art-web your POST /ascii-art handler must distinguish incoming methods
// before doing any work. This exercise builds the muscle of reading r.Method
// cleanly and using it — not just checking it.
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func methodHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// if r.URL.Path != "/method-inspector" {
	// 	http.Error(w, "page not found", http.StatusNotFound)
	// 	return
	// }
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "You made a %s request\n", r.Method)
}
